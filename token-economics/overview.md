# üç¥ Memory Swap

### Trading

{% hint style="info" %}
Token trading on **MemorySwap** is an easy way to swap one ERC20 token for another via automated liquidity pools. Swap (trade) any crypto token and you will be rewarded with MDAO on every trade.
{% endhint %}

### Liqudity

{% hint style="info" %}
**MemorySwap** allows you to provide liquidity by adding tokens to liquidity pools. When you add tokens to a liquidity pool, you will receive liquidity pool (LP) tokens.

For example, if you deposit MDAO and USDT into the liquidity pool, you will receive MDAO-USDT LP tokens. The amount of LP tokens you receive represents your share in the MDAO-USDT liquidity pool.

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing liquidity. Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may face impermanent losses. It's not all bad for liquidity providers, as you'll also get rewards in the form of transaction fees.

### Cross-Chain Bridge

{% hint style="info" %}
**MemorySwap Cross-Chain Bridge**, based on TSS threshold signature technology, is composed of distributed node network and cross-chain bridge smart contract. It is a secure and decentralized cross-chain solution implemented innovatively.
{% endhint %}

* Through the cross-chain bridge node network, a decentralized asset custody account managed by a group of nodes is generated on the target block in a distributed manner to realize the distributed custody of the tokens on the target chain.
* By deploying a cross-chain bridge smart contract on the target chain, the user initiates a token recharge to the escrow account, and the smart contract realizes the generation of the mirrored tokens on the target chain according to the status change of the escrow account, and provides the user on the target chain. The account issued the mapping token to complete the cross-chain mapping of the token.
* Users can query the mapped tokens, transfer and participate in various **DeFi** applications on the target chain at any time in their own source chain account.
* According to the user's withdrawal request for their mapped assets to the target blockchain address, the smart contract triggers the node network to complete the transfer operation of the corresponding assets in the custody account, destroys the corresponding mapped assets, and updates the user's mapped assets on the target chain. .
