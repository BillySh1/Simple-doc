# üåê Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
**MEMORY SWAP TOKEN** is an application token issued by **Memory Swap**. It is an important token to promote the development of **Memory Labs**. Based on the Memory economic model, all participants and developers are encouraged to invest in the maintenance of the overall ecological network through the community governance of tokens.
{% endhint %}

### Economic Model

In **Memory Swap's** economic model, there are two ways to earn MDAO. First, users can get airdrops through early participation in product testing and community contributions. Second, they can get mining rewards through **Memory Swap**.

On the other hand, all transaction fees for **Memory Swap** will be regularly used to buy back tokens in the open market, and will be distributed proportionally to token stake holders and development committees.

### Development Committe

The Development Committee is mainly responsible for promoting the development of the project and building the community. In the early stages, it will be comprised of **Memory Labs**, community contributors, and delegates with a majority vote. The latter stage is entirely elected by the community.

### Distribution Mechanism (For details, please check the official website)
