### Profession

**NFT** Cards are divided into five major occupations: shield, warfare, strategy, thorn, and auxiliary. In addition to the second, there are additional master occupations, only the gold card holds this occupation.

Displayed in the lower left corner of the card, the corresponding main attributes are stamina, strength, intelligence, agility, and spirit. The main attribute combat power bonus is higher than other attributes. In the player battle modules such as the elite battle module and the qualifying match, the combination of generals of each main attribute is a good choice.



### Stars

The star rating is a relatively intuitive data that reflects the strength and potential of the **NFT** card. The star rating and level will be directly reflected on the card. The left side is the current level, and the right side is the owned star level.

When you want to increase your combat power after obtaining a card, the most direct way is to buy upgrade items through the combat readiness store and go to upgrade and breakthrough. Players need to first increase the card experience value, and then break the level cap by breaking through, thereby increasing the star rating.

The star's breakthrough limit is affected by rarity. When the upper limit cannot be exceeded, players can improve the quality and rarity of the card through advanced steps, thereby breaking the breakthrough limit. We will update more channels for obtaining experience points in subsequent versions.
