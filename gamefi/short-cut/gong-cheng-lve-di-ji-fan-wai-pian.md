# Siege and Side Story

### Siege

Siege is a completely overhead metaverse world, players can continue to explore and conquer more territories in the map to gain profits. In the entire huge world, players share the same set of epoch calendars, but due to different world lines, the territories between players are not connected. We will update the method of breaking the dimensional wall in subsequent versions and continue to advance the epoch story.

After entering the siege, players can go out for **NFT** cards indefinitely, and they can choose to let the generals perform various tasks of different periods to attack the city. Each city requires a lot of mobilization to capture. After reading the main storyline, you can participate in the siege.

In the story of the era where the siege is constant, the generals when the player goes out can still trigger the bond special effect and get the combat power bonus. After the task of challenging the city is over, the player can not recall the generals who went on the expedition and order them to continue the mission. At this time, additional The generals who perform the mission will receive the help of the aborigines in the world. Players can hire the aborigines to participate in the mission through the income obtained during the expedition. The combat value of the aborigines will be proportional to the income of the player.
