Here are a couple of examples of succinct overviews from products with really great docs:

> The mission of Memory Swap is to provide consumers with the access to the cryptocurrency-based financial services, enabling them to exchange or exchange various digital assets in their Memory wallets.
>
> The strength of this design can be attributed to the inherent high security in the decentralized model of asset storage and protection. This platform also provides "cross-chain" exchange for exchange settlement in later stage, so there is no need to concern the limitations of the typical isolated block chain network.
>
> Considering the advanced development of decentralized financial agreement (DeFi), and the increasingly improvement of lending, exchange, derivatives, NFT, Gamefi, the platform agreement of Memory Swap has cooperated with the related decentralized wallet software, providing a platform with one-stop aggregation and exchange for customers, and also providing developers with access to an open, distributed, unlimited and secure trading environment.
