### **5+2 Lottery**

Using the technology of oracles and off-chain computing on-chain verification, MemoryLab has implemented a completely decentralized on-chain lottery mechanism, in which the 5+2 gameplay is similar to the lottery in the lottery industry. The prize pool funds and lottery draws are more open and transparent. Users can pay for lottery tickets with MDao, and receive their own bonuses corresponding to the prize amount after the lottery draws.
