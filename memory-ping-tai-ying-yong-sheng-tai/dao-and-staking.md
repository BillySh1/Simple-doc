# ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¬ DAO & Staking

### DAO

**MemoryDao** is a decentralized governance system fully powered by smart contracts. Holders of MDao tokens participate in governance, propose and vote on community activities, such as releasing lock-up tokens, Addition and removal of lists, use of community treasury, etc.

### Staking

The Staking module of **MemorySwap** is divided into single-currency pledge and LP pledge.

A simple understanding of single-currency pledge is to pledge a token, which can be locked and pledged or withdrawn at any time. Different methods have different annualized returns.&#x20;

For example, if you hold MDao in your hand, you can use MemorySwap's single-currency pledge pool for pledge mining.

Staking **MDAO** can get **MDAO**, etc., and the corresponding annualized income varies. LP pledge can be understood as a combination of currency trading pairs for mining, such as **MDAO-WETH**, **MDAO-USDT** and other trading pairs, and the annualized yield of different combinations is also different.&#x20;
